Bomber Party
============

We are creating a Bomberman clone for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone 8 (and potentially Windows 8 and Ouya further on down the line). Right now, we are using graphics ripped from the official Bomberman game developed by Konami for iOS.

Bomberman is a very popular franchise, known for its addictive multi-player gameplay. As of now, this franchise is poorly represented in the mobile market. The official Konami-developed version only supports up to 2 players over Bluetooth. We already have a working prototype that allows up to 8 players from multiple platforms (Android, iOS, and WP8) to play together in real-time over Wi-Fi.
