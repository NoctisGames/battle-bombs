TODO’s
----------

 * Update to the latest framework and use the Entity ID’s to address objects (this might fix the random server crashes)
 * Add Push Notifications to inform players when the online room is active

Nice to have
----------

 * Refactor server to make the Java layer as thin as possible (this way, the underlying C++ code can be used by the client to run a local Bluetooth server)
 * Implement a Mobile LAN Server (and making it open source in the process)
